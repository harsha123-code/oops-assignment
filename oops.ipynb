        "Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" is a core principle in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common interface. It enables you to define a common method in a base class (or simply agree on a method name) and have derived classes (or different classes) provide their own specific implementations of that method. When you call this method on an object, the specific implementation that corresponds to the object's actual type is executed at runtime, allowing for flexible and extensible code that can work with various object types through the same method call. The most common way to achieve this in Python is through method overriding."
